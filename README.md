# Highlights

Set of scripts to automate the construction of weekly highlights documents. 

reportgen.py - loops through a meta data dump report and pulls out relevant docs that have been created or updated within the last week or month. 4 csv reports generated based on those permutations. Shortcutted docs found by cross referencing with specific shortcut meta data reports

xmlgen.py - loops through the new and updated weekly csv files that were generated by the reportgen.py script, builds an xml document for each practice area. Also scrapes last highlights document for some sections to build brand new document.
