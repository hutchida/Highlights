- QAs in new content
- The shortcuts on the ‘newcontent’ don’t appear to be picking up content not mastered in the relevant practice areas eg this week’s report doesn’t include 3203651 for IP law as the doc is mastered in commercial. Do we need to run a similar method as that for the updated content? Eg check for masters first, then look for all shortcuts?
only picking up one instance, possibly something to do with datefirstpublished being NAN
filtering only picking up the first row
example: 3203651, 
- output to \\atlas\lexispsl\Highlights\Practice Areas with date and '_test' in the filename

- add under review column, true or false, check with luke the difference between LastReviewDate and LastUnderReviewDate
